### Target program with 3 cameras
- First Camera : The camera tilted at an angle of 40 degrees to the surface. We receive the image, calibrate the image and then change the direction from the tilt angle to the perpendicular angle to the device surface. The position error must not be more than 1mm and the angle error must not be more than 5 degrees.
- Second Camera: See the relative position after the product is on the blister to check if the product is placed in the correct position with OBB
- Third Camera: Determine the orientation of the blister to instruct the arm of Robot to interact properly for programming purposes
` P/s : The program does not have an image listing the privacy policies of the products the project directly uses. `
#### **Sumarize: Approach the product with inclined surface and give small position error to interact with robot, and run three basler cameras independently **
